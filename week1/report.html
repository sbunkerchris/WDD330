	<h1>WDD 330 Portfolio</h1>
	<h2>Week01</h2>
	<h3>Week01 Report</h3>
	<p>I dug in a bit late this week. Life was pretty crazy for my wife and I.</p>
	<p>When going over the Master Mobile UX video I realized a few things. The company I currently work for makes Listing database integrated real estate websites. and currently our system uses Responsive retrofit philosophy for our mobile sites. it works but I think its a metaphorical duck tape for the problem. We need to be designing our sites differently to work for mobile first. It will bolster the viewing experience on mobile devises and make it a near seamless transition to desktop browsing. This thought led me to think about how much work would be needed to fix this and I really don't know.</p>
	<p>Other than the reading, I seem to be having a bit of a hard time remembering much of JavaScript in general. I had a bit of difficulty getting my table of contents array to display on my page. I'm sure I'll end up making some updates to it in the future too.</p>
	<p>Ill keep at it. Onto next week!</p>
