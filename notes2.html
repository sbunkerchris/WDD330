	<h1>WDD 330 Portfolio</h1>
	<h2>Week02</h2>
	<h3>Preparation Notes</h3>
	<p>Basics of functions, statements, expressions. basic blocks of any standard code. expressions end 
		in semi colons (;). basically similar to the consruction of any writing containing words, sentences 
		pharagraphs, ect.. All these going into the overall 'story' 
	</p>
	<p>loops - a way of separating an operation especially if it needs to be perfomed more than once.</p>
	<p>how you format a document is important for seeing where the flow of that document is and the components
		of a specific operation (usefull for seeing what are implements of a loop and what the loop is).
	</p>
	<p>
		Functions - scopes and bidings - see below code<br>
		if(true){
			let y = 20;
			var z = 30;
		}<br>
		Y and Z are only visible (and accessable) within the if expression. AKA Y and Z are only availible within
		that 'scope.'
	</p>
	<p>
		Arrow Fucntions => <br>
		example: <br>
		<img src="images/arrowFunctionEx.PNG"><br>\
		this is another notation for functions with only one upside (says they will go over it later). Probably 
		won't be using too many of these (at least as far as i can think)
	</p>
	<p>recursion - AKA if/else statements</p>
	<p>Objects and Arrays - lists of data. each form has its advantages.<br>
		Arrays are strings of data.
