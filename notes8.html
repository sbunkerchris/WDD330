	<h3>Preparation Notes</h3>
	<h4>Transform</h4>
    <p>an API that allows style manipulation of an element</p>
    <h4>Translation</h4>
    <p>an API that allows movement of an element (up down left right). similar to position. Move the element without 
        impacting the flow of the document.
    </p>
    <h4>Scaling</h4>
    <p>scale an element by a factor horizonally or vertically</p>
    <h4>Rotation</h4>
    <p>rotates element around a point (default: elements center)</p>
    <h4>Transitions</h4>
    <p>allows adjustment of css over time. Delay ect.</p>
    <h4>Canvas</h4>
    <p>API allowing ability to draw any shape. You can use this so you do not need to use images. can draw lines, shapes arcs, text, gradients, patterns, abilty to manipulate pixels.</p>
    <h4>SVG</h4>
    <p>Scalabel vector Graphic (using XML). </p>
    <h4>SVG vs Canvas</h4>
    <p>canvas - you cannot add to what is already there you need to re-draw everything</p>
    <p>SVG - this is ultimately a file format rather than a set of methods that let you draw, AKA you cant manipulate a SVG image in the same way you would beablet to with Canvas.</p>
    <p>Neither is good for static iamges. Really they are meant to be best used in the sense of interactions or annimations.</p>
