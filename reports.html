      <h3><b>Week 01</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>I dug in a bit late this week. Life was pretty crazy for my wife and I.</p>
      <p>When going over the Master Mobile UX video I realized a few things. The company I currently work for makes Listing database integrated real estate websites. and currently our system uses Responsive retrofit philosophy for our mobile sites. it works but I think its a metaphorical duck tape for the problem. We need to be designing our sites differently to work for mobile first. It will bolster the viewing experience on mobile devises and make it a near seamless transition to desktop browsing. This thought led me to think about how much work would be needed to fix this and I really don't know.</p>
      <p>Other than the reading, I seem to be having a bit of a hard time remembering much of JavaScript in general. I had a bit of difficulty getting my table of contents array to display on my page. I'm sure I'll end up making some updates to it in the future too.</p>
      <p>I'll keep at it. Onto next week!</p>

    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <p>All in all this weeks reading and work was a refresher course. I use most of these poerations in my currently
            workplace every day. It is amazing to have a bit more detail and important to refresh your conceptualization
            of the terms, definitions, and other details.

      <h3><b>Week 03</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <p>Since my last meeting I set up my site (much more finished) as well as attached the data base. </p>
        <p>I will continue refining the site (still don't like how all the break views work completely).</p>
        <p>I think my greatest block is my lack of remembering some of the format of functions (JavaScript, PHP ect.) I will from time to time need to refresh my memory.</p>

        <h4>What I did since last meeting?</h4>
        <p>From last group meeting (week 3) I was definitely noticing that I needed to read more and work more with much of the reading from last week. I set up some time to go back through the group project again starting fresh (without the file we finished in the group meeting. </p>
        <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
        <p>When going through some of the reading this week i noticed some parts of Javascript that I had never used before or not used enough to be comfortable with teaching this to someone else (touchend being one of these).</p>
        <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
        <p>Other than syntax (seems to be a common theme) I want to be more comfortable with utilizing objects. I noticed how even though I understand object as an overall subject, I can be integrating them into more of what I do at work to make my pages and operations more robust.</p>

    <h3><b>Week 05</b></h3>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
      <p>This weeks reading was mostly review. However, I have found that integrating elements of testing and debugging makes programmers better programmers. The people who can utilize these are often more self sustainable as a programmer and they can consistently make more robust code/programs.</p>
      <p>Reading over this reminds me that I should be using it more. </p>
      <p>This reminder was a good one. </p>
      <p>This week during the group activity i got discouraged because of how many different ways I tried to get the css to conform the way i wanted it and i still ended up peeking and the professor solution. I guess I need to get to a point that im more comfortable with my code.</p>
