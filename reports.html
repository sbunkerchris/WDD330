      <h3><b>Week 01</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <p>I dug in a bit late this week. Life was pretty crazy for my wife and I.</p>
      <p>When going over the Master Mobile UX video I realized a few things. The company I currently work for makes Listing database integrated real estate websites. and currently our system uses Responsive retrofit philosophy for our mobile sites. it works but I think its a metaphorical duck tape for the problem. We need to be designing our sites differently to work for mobile first. It will bolster the viewing experience on mobile devises and make it a near seamless transition to desktop browsing. This thought led me to think about how much work would be needed to fix this and I really don't know.</p>
      <p>Other than the reading, I seem to be having a bit of a hard time remembering much of JavaScript in general. I had a bit of difficulty getting my table of contents array to display on my page. I'm sure I'll end up making some updates to it in the future too.</p>
      <p>I'll keep at it. Onto next week!</p>

      <h3><b>Week 02</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <p>All in all this weeks reading and work was a refresher course. I use most of these poerations in my currently
            workplace every day. It is amazing to have a bit more detail and important to refresh your conceptualization
            of the terms, definitions, and other details.

      <h3><b>Week 03</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <p>Since my last meeting I set up my site (much more finished) as well as attached the data base. </p>
        <p>I will continue refining the site (still don't like how all the break views work completely).</p>
        <p>I think my greatest block is my lack of remembering some of the format of functions (JavaScript, PHP ect.) I will from time to time need to refresh my memory.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h4>What I did since last meeting?</h4>
        <p>From last group meeting (week 3) I was definitely noticing that I needed to read more and work more with much of the reading from last week. I set up some time to go back through the group project again starting fresh (without the file we finished in the group meeting. </p>
        <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
        <p>When going through some of the reading this week i noticed some parts of Javascript that I had never used before or not used enough to be comfortable with teaching this to someone else (touchend being one of these).</p>
        <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
        <p>Other than syntax (seems to be a common theme) I want to be more comfortable with utilizing objects. I noticed how even though I understand object as an overall subject, I can be integrating them into more of what I do at work to make my pages and operations more robust.</p>

    <h3><b>Week 05</b></h3>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
      <p>This weeks reading was mostly review. However, I have found that integrating elements of testing and debugging makes programmers better programmers. The people who can utilize these are often more self sustainable as a programmer and they can consistently make more robust code/programs.</p>
      <p>Reading over this reminds me that I should be using it more. </p>
      <p>This reminder was a good one. </p>
      <p>This week during the group activity i got discouraged because of how many different ways I tried to get the css to conform the way i wanted it and i still ended up peeking and the professor solution. I guess I need to get to a point that im more comfortable with my code.</p>

    <h3><b>Week 07</b></h3>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
      <p>This week going over everything i think my biggest problem will be with Ajax. Though Ajax is very close to any query you would do using servers they syntax will definitely be a struggling point for me. I've used this API in the past but prefer other options (jquery and php) over it. I think i will learn much more as i get used to how to use GET, POST, PUT, ect. functions in my practice and my assignments.</p>
      <p>I think when i have some spare moments this next week i will practice some challenges regaurding Ajax.</p>

    <h3><b>Week 08</b></h3>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
      <p>This week I really did learn a lot more than I thought I would. I know that JSON and AJAX are an area where I lack in both knowledge and experience and I think I have gained a lot from the use of it both in my Group and in the couple of challenges I did  do on my own after last weeks reading.</p>
      <p>I still think I should try to use this newly gained knowledge if I have the chance. </p>
      <p>Re learning drag and drop, as well as SVG files was a great refresher as I do occasionally use these in my current workplace. SVG files particularly as this is a great way to enter large amounts of information into databases and other server data environments.</p>

    <h3><b>Week 09</b></h3>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
      <p>Since last report I have done a lot of thought into my project as well as completed all the required readings for this week.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday during our group meeting I found the group project interesting. One of the things i have not hade to work with a lot is the use of sound files within a website. Usually the most i have used sound is the implementation of YouTube or Vimeo embed to allow the capability to show videos within a web page. </p>
      <p>as we worked through the group activity i think i would love to use this sounds in some way for websites probably within user interfaces or hover over actions.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the reading i had a question about if there was a way to tract the position that a viewer was at on a particular page. If they were scrolling down a list of items or information if they clicked on an item and then went back is there a way of use BOM to return them to that area on the page they had been before.</p>
      <p>Anyway overall a good week.</p>

    <h3><b>Week 10</b></h3>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
      <p>This last week went well. The readings for this week are things I have used before. not everyday, but I am familiar with them. I worked more on my CSS and did a few challenges regarding CSS using flex box and flex to ensure I can accurately get CSS to work the way I envision it. The group activity this week was pretty straight forward. I started more work on my project to finalize some of the interface. I have also started blocking out the main files in the project and should start on the basic html for the project next week.</p>

    <h3><b>Week 11</b></h3>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
      <p>This last week went by real fast. I should have worked on my final project more.</p>
      <p>On my project I've gotten all the files and snubbed all the functions and started fleshing out the main file.</p>
      <p>I also think I may have bitten off more than I can chew. I'm overwhelmed by how much i need to get done and how little time I have to do it in.</p>
      <p>This week when we did the group challenge and I was grasping at straws to get things to work. I guess even when i read through everything I don't get it all  and don't get the best experience with it.</p>
      <p>Anyway...Hard week.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="container">
      <p>man this week was a scramble. I'm starting to think that taking time off is deceptive. I made sure to make good headway before independence weekend hit. it took until this weekend to catch up to where i had planned to be on my personal project.</p>
      <p>I have fleshed out much of the main code for the site but i will need to keep up the work on it day by day.</p>

    <h3><b>Week 13</b></h3>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
      <p>Though this doesn't have to do much with this class, I have been under an extreme amount of pressure this last week, between work on the projects i have both for this course and my other courses, making home life function, and work responsibilities, I feel that I have done the best I can at being ahead of the ball when it comes to what is required of me. </p>
      <p>I do know that when it comes down to it I will be doing a bit of staying up later to make sure everything for my final project gets done. I GOT THIS!</p>
